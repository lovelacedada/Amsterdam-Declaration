# To write my poem into the global DNS infrastructre
# Set up a web server, all on my own.
# Draft my poem in three lines:
#   LarryWallisnotaMonk.com
#   LarryWallisnotabrother.com
#   unityunityuntiy.com
# Purchase the assets for each line of the poem.
# Set up the ip/webservice stuff that I am sure won't freak me out when I get to it.
# A wee bit of logic on my server so that once you go to the first URL.
# you silently bounce through the non-interactive poem.
# Then upgrade my poem and dada pages from my github.
# Global reach. 24 hours. No publisher required.
# dada
